                <div class="p1">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like
                    to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream;
                    I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the
                    moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming
                    from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
                    experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer,
                    leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be
                    alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like countrys peace,
                    I like nature noise, I like the beautiful views specially in mountains.I like delicious food and
                    comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like
                    people. And, I like to laugh.</div>

            <h4>Childhood</h4>
            <div>My childhood experience began when I was eleven, and was able to spend the summer with my best friend
                named Clark, who I had known since the age of three. Once we came from our summer trip, we had an
                argument that would cause me to live with a lifelong regret. The final part of my experience was going
                two years of not talking, than getting news that would change me into the person I am today. Overall, my
                childhood experience consisted of a summer of traveling, an argument with my best friend, and news that
                would teach me a valuable life lesson. The lesson I learned was to apologize when you have done wrong,
                because you never know what someone else is going through.</div>

                <div>Being a teenager, my mind is most impressionable and vulnerable at this time. I try to make the
                    right decisions, and learn from the wrong ones. Its been very hard to be a teenager. I regret what
                    I've done, and regret what I haven't done. This is the time in my life when I am trying to figure
                    out who I really am, why I am here, and trying to understand what the world is like.
                    My scathing at times, and constructive at other times teen life began when I was thirteen. I had
                    already been following the so called "wrong path," that I was taught about in elementary school,
                    church, and warned about by everyone else.</div>
                <div>My teenage years were a rollercoaster. For the most part, I had a lot of growing up to do and to
                    figure out my future ahead of me. Like most teenagers, I was mainly focused on my own difficulties
                    and great moments. Many times, I found myself in complicated situations ashamed to talk about.</div>
